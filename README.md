# WiFi_device_fingerprint
Datasets and codes for extracting nonlinear phase errors as WiFi devices fingerprints based on CSIs (Channel State Information). All data is collected at 2.4GHz OFDM wireless signal.

Dataset I
===
Raw CSIs of smart devices collected by Linux 802.11n CSI Tool based on IPC with Intel5300 NIC.
Devices list is as follows: 
---
|        Device      |Quantity|
|--------------------|--------|
| laptop with AR9580 |   3    |
| laptop with AR5B22 |   3    |
|   Huawei Mate 9    |   2    |
|   Huawei Watch 1   |   3    |
|     OnePlus 3      |   2    |
|   Huawei Mate 10   |   2    |
|   Samsung S7 edge  |   2    |
|      Nexus 6P      |   2    |
|    Other devices   |   11   |
